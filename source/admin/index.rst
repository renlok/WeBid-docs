Auction Extension Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Auctions Auto extension gives you the ability to automatically extend by X seconds the auctions end time, if someone bids in the last Y seconds of the auction lifetime.

For example, if you want your auctions to add **15 seconds** everytime someone bids when there is **60 seconds** left in the auction, you would change the following:

**Enable Auctions Auto extension?** Yes

**Extend auction by** 15 **seconds if someone bid during the last** 60 **seconds**
